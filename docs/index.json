We aim for a supportive and fun culture of learning together, and hope to offer something to participants at any experience level.\nIn each meeting, a presenter first introduces a concept or tool to be used for a challenge. Then, we work on the challenge in pairs or trios in Zoom \u0026ldquo;breakout rooms,\u0026rdquo; and finally, we reconvene to see what approaches were taken and to share lessons learned.\nThe idea for this Code Club was taken from a recent paper in PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules to increase computational skills among biologists with Code Clubs. We liked this idea because of the high level of interaction and because gradual, well-spaced practice is an excellent way to retain what you learn.\nJoin us \u0026mdash; and perhaps present a session too! As the organizers, we are happy to present sessions, but we hope that as a participant, you will also want to do so.\nFor example, you could consult the group about an actual challenge you are facing in your data analysis. You could also introduce everyone to an new package or approach you\u0026rsquo;ve been using, or one that you are excited about and want to dive into \u0026ndash; teaching a topic can be one of the best ways to learn it!\nPractical information  In the first series, we will focus on all things R: from data analysis and visualization to efficient coding, R Markdown, and so on. There will be no consistent analysis type or data type \u0026mdash; instead, we will focus on building general skills and applying those to a wide variety of data. Each week, materials and suggested reading will be posted up front at the Sessions page. Like at a Journal Club, doing some preparatory homework by reading these materials will help you get the most out of it. Each session is intended to be mostly stand-alone to allow for occasional participation. To allow for a welcoming environment for participants at all levels of experience, we ask everyone to be respectful, patient, and collaborative when interacting at Code Club. This is not a competitive event. We have a separate page with computer setup instructions, where you\u0026rsquo;ll see that we also accommodate participating through your browser without any installations. We also have a form to suggest topics for Code Club!

If you want to send your R Markdown file by email, skip this and continue to Step 2.\nThe following assumes you have git installed (if not, see these instructions), and a Github account (if not, sign up here).\n  Go to a dir that you would like to be the parent dir of the Biodash/Codeclub repo:\ncd my-dir   Clone the repo:\ngit clone git@github.com:biodash/biodash.github.io.git   Move into the newly downloaded repo dir:\ncd biodash   Create a new branch (by way of example called \u0026ldquo;my-branch\u0026rdquo;) and switch to it:\ngit checkout -b my-branch   Step 2: Create a new post in R   Start an R session.\n  If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the hugodown package installed, install it:\nremotes::install_github(\u0026#34;r-lib/hugodown\u0026#34;)   A post bundle is a separate folder for a post which will hold the R Markdown file that contains the post, as well as associated images and so on.

Click the link or copy and paste the address into a browser, and you will see the rendered website. Until you press Ctrl + C on the command line, the server will keep running and will update whenever you save changes in a file within the website directory.\n  Step 4: Commit your changes   Add the files from your post:\ngit add post/\u0026lt;your-post-name\u0026gt;/*   Commit:\ngit commit -m \u0026#34;Add CodeClub session \u0026lt;session-nr\u0026gt; by \u0026lt;your-name\u0026gt;\u0026#34;   Step 5: Get your post onto the website repo Your Markdown (.md) file will be built along with the rest of the website by a program called Hugo (Hugo does not recognize R Markdown (Rmd) files, that\u0026rsquo;s why you needed to Knit your R Markdown yourself).\nThis will eventually be done automatically via Github actions; but as long as that has not yet been set up, Jelmer will manually call Hugo to build the website.\nOption A: Create a pull request When you create a pull request, you are asking the maintainers of a repository to pull your changes into their repository.\n  Push to your branch:\ngit push origin my-branch   Create the pull request:\n Go to the Pull requests page of our repo at https://github.com/biodash/biodash.github.io/pulls. Click the green button on the right that says New pull request. In the grey bar on top, in the button that says Compare: \u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;, make sure the branch specifiied is your branch, which we\u0026rsquo;ve named my-branch in these instructions. Enter a title (e.g. \u0026ldquo;New Post: Session 6\u0026quot;) and description (say a little more about the post) for the pull request. Click the green button Send pull request.    Option B: Push to the site repo (direct access required)   Merge your branch with the main (master) branch:\ngit checkout master # Move to the master branch prior to merging git merge my-branch # Merge into master (assuming your branch was named \u0026#34;my-branch\u0026#34;)   Push to the master branch:\ngit push origin master      \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d2a87fb5a2b4f8e331f2a7033b4ca3df","permalink":"https://mcic2.github.io/codeclub-present/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/codeclub-present/","section":"","summary":"For presenters   Each Code Club session represents a blogpost on the website at https://biodash.github.io/post/.\n  Regular presenters will be given direct access to the Github repository and will be able to push a new post to the website directly.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Upcoming sessions Here we will post a tentative schedule for the next few sessions.

Additional setup for individual sessions (e.g., installing a specific package), will be stated clearly in the posts for each session.\nYou may prefer to install the software locally, so you can easily practice outside of Code Club. Alternatively, you can access RStudio (as well as the terminal and Jupyter Notebooks) through your browser at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), where Code Club has a Classroom Project.\nLocal installation Summary of what you need  R \u0026ndash; preferably version \u0026gt;= 4.0.0, but at least 3.0.1 RStudio R packages that we will regularly use:  tidyverse    Install R  Windows: Download and run the .exe file for the latest version of R from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/, by clicking the large Download R [version-number] for Windows link at the top of the gray box. Mac: Download and run the .pkg file for the latest version of R from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/, by clicking the link just below Latest release. On a Linux distribution, you can also install R using the website above, but you may prefer to use a package manager instead \u0026ndash; for instance, seee these instructions for installing the latest R version on Ubuntu 20.04 using the apt package manager.  Install RStudio RStudio is a so-called Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for R, with side-by-side panes for an R script, an R concole, plots, help documents, and much more. While it is perfectly possible to use R without RStudio, RStudio has become the de facto standard for working with R and is very useful.\nTo install RStudio, go to the RStudio download page and download and run the installer file for your operating system.\nInstall the tidyverse Install the tidyverse, which is a collection of useful packages, by typing the following command inside an R console:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;) \nAdditional info about setting up R Updating R If you have an older version of R already installed, consider updating it (certainly do this your R version is below 3.0.1, and preferably do this if your R version is below 4.0).\n Windows: Use the function installr::updateR() in an R console (if needed, first install installr using install.packages(\u0026quot;installr\u0026quot;)). Mac: Download and install the latest .pkg file as if you were installing it for the first time. Linux: In Ubuntu, if you installed R with apt or apt-get, you can use apt-get upgrade in a terminal. Otherwise, download and install the latest version after removing the old one. Rtask has some instructions for upgrading to R 4.0 in Ubuntu (along with upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04).  Re-installing your packages after updating (Mac and Linux) While the installr::updateR() function for Windows users takes care of reinstalling your packages along with updating R, Mac and Linux users will have to manually re-install their packages. Some people prefer to re-install these packages on the fly, which can end up being a way to get rid of packages you no longer use.\nBut if you want immediately reinstall all your packages, run this before you upgrade:\nmy_packages \u0026lt;- installed.packages() saveRDS(my_packages, \u0026#34;my_packages.rds\u0026#34;) Then, after you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the latest R version:\nmy_packages \u0026lt;- readRDS(\u0026#34;CurrentPackages.rds\u0026#34;) install.packages(my_packages[1, ]) This will only work for packages available on CRAN. Of course, you can check your list for Github-only and Bioconductor packages and then install those with their respective commands (see below). Yes, this can be a bit of a hassle!\nInstalling R packages To install an R package that is available at CRAN, the default R package repository, from within R (e.g. in the R console in RStudio), use the install.packages() function.\nThe install.packages() function will handle dependencies within R \u0026ndash; i.e., it will install other R packages that your package depends on. Occasionally, when the install function needs to compile a package from source, errors arise that relate to missing system dependencies (i.e. software outside of R).\nOn Mac and Linux, these system dependencies are best installed outside of R, such as with homebrew on Mac or apt on Ubuntu. The installation errror message should tell you which libraries are needed.\nOn Windows, you can use the installr package to install such dependencies or other software from within R \u0026ndash; for example:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;installr\u0026#34;) # Install the installr package first installlr::install.RStudio() # Install RStudio installr::install.python() # Install Python Packages from other sources Some packages are not available on CRAN. The two main alternative places that you may want to install packages from are Github and (if you are working with bioinformatics data) Bioconductor.\nTo install a package from Github, use the remotes package \u0026ndash; for example:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;remotes\u0026#34;) # Install the remotes package remotes::install_github(\u0026#34;kbroman/broman\u0026#34;) # Install from a repository using \u0026#34;\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo-name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; To install a package from Bioconductor, use the BiocManager package \u0026ndash; for example:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;BiocManager\u0026#34;) # Install the BiocManager package BiocManager::install(\u0026#34;edgeR\u0026#34;) # Install the edgeR package from Bioconductor Useful settings By default, R will try to save your \u0026ldquo;environment\u0026rdquo; (e.g., your loaded data, variables, etc) when you exit, and then reload everything the way it was upon restarting R. However, this is bad! You should always be able to reproduce your environment given a set of commands saved in an R script or R Markdown document, whereas saving and reloading your environment encourages you to be sloppy about this.\nTo disable this in RStudio, go to Tools \u0026gt; Global Options \u0026gt; General and set the options as follows:\n  Recommended R/RStudio settings   To start R in the same way from the command line:\nR --no-save --no-restore-data \nOSC Sign up at OSC All Code Club participants automatically get access to the OSC Classroom Project for Code Club (PAS1838). This way, you can work e.g. in RStudio from your browser rather than with a local installation. However, you only need to do this if you prefer not to install anything, or if you have problems with locally installing the software or individual packages \u0026ndash; we will not be running heavy computational analyses that will require the use of the cluster.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t already have an OSC account, you do need to sign up:\n Go to https://my.osc.edu/ and click the blue \u0026ldquo;Sign Up\u0026rdquo; bar. In the bottom right portion of the form where you provide your info (see screenshot below), you should enter Code Club\u0026rsquo;s Project Code, which is PAS1838.    Enter Project Code PAS1838 in the red box (click to enlarge)   Use RStudio with OSC OnDemand OSC OnDemand lets you access OSC resources through your browser and run a couple of applications with GUIs, like RStudio.\n To get started, go to https://ondemand.osc.edu/ and log in with your OSC username and password. Then, click on Interactive Apps in the blue top bar, and select RStudio Server (Owens and Pitzer). Now, you\u0026rsquo;re on a page from which you can launch an RStudio server that will run on an OSC cluster.  Under Cluster, either Owens or Pitzer will work. Under R version, keep the default of 4.02. Under Project, if PAS1838 is not already entered, enter it. Under Number of hours, enter 2. Under Node type, keep the default of any. Under Number of cores, keep the default of 1. Keep the box I would like to receive an email when the session starts unchecked. Click Launch.   Now, you should see a box like this:    Your job should start running pretty soon, and when it\u0026rsquo;s ready the box should look like this:    Click Connect to RStudio Server at the bottom of the box, and an RStudio Server instance will open. You\u0026rsquo;re ready to go!  General info about using OSC The above instructions should be all you need to access RStudio using OSC, but there is lot more to OSC than that! For more information about using OSC, their website has excellent resources \u0026ndash; if you work your way through the Getting Started materials, you should be pretty far along! In particular, once you\u0026rsquo;re up and running with the basics, it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking through the topics in the HOWTOs.\nOur very own Mike Sovic also has a YouTube playlist \u0026ldquo;Getting Started With High Performance Computing (HPC)\u0026quot; at his channel The Data Point.\n   \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a19fd71e3dc86af820a45dabc994dda5","permalink":"https://mcic2.github.io/codeclub-setup/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/codeclub-setup/","section":"","summary":"Computer setup Here, you will find some general information on computer setup for Code Club.
