We aim for a supportive and fun culture of learning together, and hope to offer something to participants at any experience level.\nIn each meeting, a presenter first introduces a concept or tool to be used for a challenge. Then, we work on the challenge in pairs or trios in Zoom \u0026ldquo;breakout rooms,\u0026rdquo; and finally, we reconvene to see what approaches were taken and to share lessons learned.\nThe idea for this Code Club was taken from a recent paper in PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules to increase computational skills among biologists with Code Clubs. We liked this idea because of the high level of interaction and because gradual, well-spaced practice is an excellent way to retain what you learn.\nJoin us \u0026mdash; and perhaps present a session too! As the organizers, we are happy to present sessions, but we hope that as a participant, you will also want to do so.\nFor example, you could consult the group about an actual challenge you are facing in your data analysis. You could also introduce everyone to an new package or approach you\u0026rsquo;ve been using, or one that you are excited about and want to dive into \u0026ndash; teaching a topic can be one of the best ways to learn it!\nPractical information  In the first series, we will focus on all things R: from data analysis and visualization to efficient coding, R Markdown, and so on. There will be no consistent analysis type or data type (e.g. genomic data); instead, we will focus on building general skills and applying those to a wide variety of data. Each week, materials and suggested reading will be posted up front at the Sessions page. Like at a Journal Club, doing some preparatory homework by reading these materials will help you get the most out of it. Each session is intended to be mostly stand-alone to allow for occasional participation. To allow for a welcoming environment for participants at all levels of experience, we ask everyone to be respectful, patient, and collaborative when interacting at Code Club. This is not a competitive event. Installation instructions TBA We also have a form to suggest topics for Code Club!

Here, \u0026lt;session-number\u0026gt; should be replaced by the actual Code Club session number, and \u0026lt;short-title\u0026gt; should be replaced by the actual short title (which will be used for links and the folder name) that you would like to give the post. So, an example would be hugodown::use_post('post/01_intro-to-R'). Write your actual post in R Markdown format. Convert your .Rmd (R Markdown) file to a .md (Markdown) file, which is done most easitly by \u0026ldquo;knitting\u0026rdquo; your post in RStudio by clicking Knit in the top bar or pressing Ctrl + Shift + K.

Additional setup for individual sessions (e.g., installing a specific package), will be stated clearly in the posts for each session.\nYou may prefer to install the software locally, so you can easily practice outside of Code Club. Alternatively, you can access RStudio (as well as the terminal and Jupyter Notebooks) through your browser at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), where Code Club has a Classroom Project.\nLocal installation Summary of what you need  R \u0026ndash; preferably version \u0026gt;= 4.0.0, but at least 3.0.1 RStudio R packages that we will regularly use:  tidyverse    Install R  Windows: Download and run the .exe file for the latest version of R from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/, by clicking the large Download R [version-number] for Windows link at the top of the gray box. Mac: Download and run the .pkg file for the latest version of R from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/, by clicking the link just below Latest release. On a Linux distribution, you can also install R using the website above, but you may prefer to use a package manager instead \u0026ndash; for instance, seee these instructions for installing the latest R version on Ubuntu 20.04 using the apt package manager.  Install RStudio RStudio is a so-called Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for R, with side-by-side panes for an R script, an R concole, plots, help documents, and much more. While it is perfectly possible to use R without RStudio, RStudio has become the de facto standard for working with R and is very useful.\nTo install RStudio, go to the RStudio download page and download and run the installer file for your operating system.\nInstall the tidyverse Install the tidyverse, which is a collection of useful packages, by typing the following command inside an R console:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;) \nAdditional info about setting up R Updating R If you have an older version of R already installed, consider updating it (certainly do this your R version is below 3.0.1, and preferably do this if your R version is below 4.0).\n Windows: Use the function installr::updateR() in an R console. Mac: Download and install the latest .pkg file as if you were installing it for the first time. Linux: In Ubuntu, if you installed R with apt or apt-get, you can use apt-get upgrade in a terminal. Otherwise, simply download and install the latest version.  Re-installing your packages after updating TBA\nInstalling R packages To install an R package that is available at CRAN, the default R package repository, from within R (e.g. in the R console in RStudio), use the install.packages() function.\nThe install.packages() function will handle dependencies within R \u0026ndash; i.e., it will install other R packages that your package depends on. Occasionally, when the install function needs to compile a package from source, errors arise that relate to missing system dependencies (i.e. software outside of R).\nOn Mac and Linux, these system dependencies are best installed outside of R, such as with homebrew on Mac or apt on Ubuntu. The installation errror message should tell you which libraries are needed.\nOn Windows, you can use the installr package to install such dependencies or other software from within R \u0026ndash; for example:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;installr\u0026#34;) # Install the installr package first installlr::install.RStudio() # Install RStudio installr::install.python() # Install Python Packages from other sources Some packages are not available on CRAN. The two main alternative places that you may want to install packages from are Github and (if you are working with bioinformatics data) Bioconductor.\nTo install a package from Github, use the remotes package \u0026ndash; for example:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;remotes\u0026#34;) # Install the remotes package remotes::install_github(\u0026#34;kbroman/broman\u0026#34;) # Install from a repository using \u0026#34;\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo-name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; To install a package from Bioconductor, use the BiocManager package \u0026ndash; for example:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;BiocManager\u0026#34;) # Install the BiocManager package BiocManager::install(\u0026#34;edgeR\u0026#34;) # Install the edgeR package from Bioconductor Useful settings By default, R will try to save your \u0026ldquo;environment\u0026rdquo; (e.g., your loaded data, variables, etc) when you exit, and then reload everything the way it was upon restarting R. However, this is bad! You should always be able to reproduce your environment given a set of commands saved in an R script or R Markdown document, whereas saving and reloading your environment encourages you to be sloppy about this.\nTo disable this in RStudio, go to Tools \u0026gt; Global Options \u0026gt; General and set the options as follows:\n  Recommended R/RStudio settings   To start R in the same way from the command line:\nR --no-save --no-restore-data \nOSC Sign up at OSC All Code Club participants automatically get access to the OSC Classroom Project for Code Club (PAS1838). This way, you can work e.g. in RStudio from your browser rather than with a local installation. However, you only need to do this if you prefer not to install anything, or if you have problems with locally installing the software or individual packages \u0026ndash; we will not be running heavy computational analyses that will require the use of the cluster.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t already have an OSC account, you do need to sign up:\n Go to https://my.osc.edu/ and click the blue \u0026ldquo;Sign Up\u0026rdquo; bar. In the bottom right portion of the form where you provide your info (see screenshot below), you should enter Code Club\u0026rsquo;s Project Code, which is PAS1838.    Enter Project Code PAS1838 in the red box (click to enlarge)   Use RStudio with OSC OnDemand OSC OnDemand lets you access OSC resources through your browser and run a couple of applications with GUIs, like RStudio.\n To get started, go to https://ondemand.osc.edu/ and log in with your OSC username and password. Then, click on Interactive Apps in the blue top bar, and select RStudio Server (Owens and Pitzer). Now, you\u0026rsquo;re on a page from which you can launch an RStudio server that will run on an OSC cluster.  Under Cluster, either Owens or Pitzer will work. Under R version, keep the default of 4.02. Under Project, if PAS1838 is not already entered, enter it. Under Number of hours, enter 2. Under Node type, keep the default of any. Under Number of cores, keep the default of 1. Keep the box I would like to receive an email when the session starts unchecked. Click Launch.   Now, you should see a box like this:    Your job should start running pretty soon, and when it\u0026rsquo;s ready the box should look like this:    Click Connect to RStudio Server at the bottom of the box, and an RStudio Server instance will open. You\u0026rsquo;re ready to go!  General info about using OSC The above instructions should be all you need to access RStudio using OSC, but there is lot more to OSC than that! For more information about using OSC, their website has excellent resources \u0026ndash; if you work your way through the Getting Started materials, you should be pretty far along! In particular, once you\u0026rsquo;re up and running with the basics, it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking through the topics in the HOWTOs.\nOur very own Mike Sovic also has a YouTube playlist \u0026ldquo;Getting Started With High Performance Computing (HPC)\u0026quot; at his channel The Data Point.\n   \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a19fd71e3dc86af820a45dabc994dda5","permalink":"https://mcic2.github.io/codeclub-setup/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/codeclub-setup/","section":"","summary":"Computer setup Here, you will find some general information on computer setup for Code Club.
