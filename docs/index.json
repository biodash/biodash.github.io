We aim for a supportive and fun culture of learning together, and hope to offer something to participants at any experience level.\nIn each meeting, a presenter first introduces a concept or tool to be used for a challenge. Then, we work on the challenge in pairs or trios in Zoom \u0026ldquo;breakout rooms,\u0026rdquo; and finally, we reconvene to see what approaches were taken and to share lessons learned.\nThe idea for this Code Club was taken from a recent paper in PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules to increase computational skills among biologists with Code Clubs. We liked this idea because of the high level of interaction and because gradual, well-spaced practice is an excellent way to retain what you learn.\nJoin us \u0026mdash; and perhaps present a session too! As the organizers, we are happy to present sessions, but we hope that as a participant, you will also want to do so.\nFor example, you could consult the group about an actual challenge you are facing in your data analysis. You could also introduce everyone to an new package or approach you\u0026rsquo;ve been using, or one that you are excited about and want to dive into \u0026ndash; teaching a topic can be one of the best ways to learn it!\nPractical information  In the first series, we will focus on all things R: from data analysis and visualization to efficient coding, R Markdown, and so on. There will be no consistent analysis type or data type (e.g. genomic data); instead, we will focus on building general skills and applying those to a wide variety of data. Each week, materials and suggested reading will be posted up front at the Sessions page. Like at a Journal Club, doing some preparatory homework by reading these materials will help you get the most out of it. Each session is intended to be mostly stand-alone to allow for occasional participation. To allow for a welcoming environment for participants at all levels of experience, we ask everyone to be respectful, patient, and collaborative when interacting at Code Club. This is not a competitive event. Installation instructions TBA We also have a form to suggest topics for Code Club!  Sign up To sign up, please fill out the Google Form below.\n Hope to see you at Code Club!\nJelmer Poelstra, Mike Sovic, Stephen Opiyo, Michael Broe, and Jessica Cooperstone\nLoading…    \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"affd8a75456abca4d01de73213cffddb","permalink":"https://mcic2.github.io/codeclub-about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/codeclub-about/","section":"","summary":"About OSU Code Club OSU Code Club is a regularly occurring, interactive, online gathering to improve coding skills.

How to create a new post in R:  If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the hugodown package installed, install it using devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;r-lib/hugodown\u0026quot;). Use hugodown::use_post('post/\u0026lt;session-number\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;short-title\u0026gt;') to create a new \u0026ldquo;post bundle\u0026rdquo;, which is a separate folder for a post, with an R Markdown file that has many useful YAML header tags already present. Here, \u0026lt;session-number\u0026gt; should be replaced by the actual Code Club session number, and \u0026lt;short-title\u0026gt; should be replaced by the actual short title (which will be used for links and the folder name) that you would like to give the post.
