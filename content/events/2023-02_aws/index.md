# Online AWS Workshop

Wednesday, February 28th, 2023 -- 3-5 pm -- online-only

<br>

----

Code Club will organize a free workshop from 3-5 pm on Amazon Web Services (AWS),
led by AWS instructors.
The workshop will take place on Wednesday February 28th, 2023, from 3-5 pm.

### Why cloud computing with AWS?

When you are working with datasets that are too large to be analyzed with your
personal computer,
you'll need access to a more powerful infrastructure.

At Ohio State, we are lucky to have access to the excellent high-performance
computing resources at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) HPC,
but another way to access such resources is with "cloud computing" services,
such as those offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Some advantages of cloud computing over HPCs include that it's available
globally with the same interface,
that there's a wider array of resources for specific requirements,
that there is no "queuing" of compute jobs,
and that you have full administrative rights to the cloud machine you are using.

### Workshop description

Here is what will be covered during this general immersion day on AWS:

- High level introduction to the AWS cloud and an overview of the
  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) _[15 mins]_
- Launching, configuring, and customizing a web server on Amazon EC2 using the
  AWS Management Console (Lab) _[45 mins]_
- Details on AWS storage products and features such as EBS, S3, EFS, Glacier _[15 mins]_
- Simple Storage Service (S3) Hands on Lab.
  In this lab, you will create an S3 bucket,
  add objects to your bucket, and access the data from EC2 _[45 mins]_

### Practicalities

- The workshop will be online-only, via Zoom
  (we'll send the link when you sign up).

- The workshop is free, and anyone at OSC can join.

- You don't need an AWS account, any specific software,
  or any specific experience to participate.
