# Code Club: <br/> R -- Getting Started and Some Tips

----
<br>

## New to R?
If you are completely new to R, we recommend watching at least the first couple of
videos from [Mike Sovic's Youtube playlist of short videos on R](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxhIMi78eQegFm3XqsylVa-Lm7nfiUshe),
and ideally all of them, prior to attending Code Club. Here is the first video:

In case you want to do more self-study (note that this is *not* required/needed),
here are some additional resources:
- A useful and fun written tutorial is [R for cats](https://rforcats.net/).
- For a more systematic and lengthy introduction to R, see 
  [A Tutorial Introduction to R](https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/)
  (this gets fairly advanced after section 9).
- Excellent comprehensive introductions are the [R Basics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics)
  and [Visualization](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-visualization) classes by Rafael Irizarry
  that can be freely accessed; you do have to create an account. 
- OSU TDAI videos:
  - [Installing R / R Studio](https://mediasite.osu.edu/Mediasite/Play/f7d6605508f842d09fd5b5ec9c88619a1d)

## Miscellaneous R tips

### Useful settings

By default, R will try to save your "environment" (e.g., your loaded data, variables, etc)
when you exit, and then reload everything the way it was upon restarting R. However, this is bad!
You should always be able to reproduce your environment given a set of commands
saved in an R script or R Markdown document, whereas saving and reloading your environment
encourages you to be sloppy about this.

To disable this in RStudio, go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `General` and set the options
as follows:

To start R in the same way from the command line:

```r
R --no-save --no-restore-data
```

### Installing R packages

#### CRAN packages
To install an R package that is available at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the default R package repository,
from within R (e.g. in the R console in RStudio), use the `install.packages()` function.

The `install.packages()` function will handle dependencies within R -- i.e., it will install other R packages
that your package depends on. Occasionally, when the install function needs to compile
a package from source, errors arise that relate to missing system dependencies (i.e. software outside of R).

On **Mac** and **Linux**, these system dependencies are best installed outside of R,
such as with `homebrew` on Mac or `apt` on Ubuntu.
The errror message you got when trying to install an R package should tell you which system dependencies are needed.

On Windows, you can use the `installr` package to install such dependencies or other software from within R -- for example:

```r
install.packages("installr")    # Install the installr package first
installlr::install.RStudio()    # Install RStudio
installr::install.python()      # Install Python
```

<br>

#### System setup to installing packages "from source"

Sometimes you need to install a package from source, that is,
you need to compile the package rather than simply installing a pre-existing binary.
(On **Linux**, where installing from source is often needed, this should work without additional steps.) 
On **Windows** and **Mac**, installing from source is generally only needed when you
install a package from outside of CRAN (such as from Github, see below),
*but* you will need to make sure you have the following non-R software:

**On **Windows**, you will need *Rtools* ([Rtools installation instructions](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)).**

**On a Mac, you will need *Xcode* (which can be installed from the Mac App store).**

You can test whether or not you are able to install packages from source using the *devtools* package:

```r
install.packages("devtools")    # Install the devtools package
devtools::has_devel()           # Check whether you can install packages from source
```

For a bit more info, see [this page](https://rstats.wtf/set-up-an-r-dev-environment.html).

<br>

#### Installing packages from Github

To install a package from Github, use either the *devtools* or the *remotes* package -- for example:

```r
install.packages("devtools")                # Install the devtools package
devtools::install_github("kbroman/broman")  # Install from a repository using "<username>/<repo-name>"
```

This will install the package *from source*, so you will need to make sure you are able to do so
by following the instructions in the section right above this one.

<br>

#### Installing packages from Bioconductor

If you're doing bioinformatic analyses in R, you will probably run into packages
that are not on CRAN but on [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/).
To install a package from Bioconductor, use the *BiocManager* package -- for example:

```r
install.packages("BiocManager")  # Install the BiocManager package
BiocManager::install("edgeR")    # Install the edgeR package from Bioconductor
```

<br>

### Updating R

Consider updating R if you have an older version of R installed.
**Specifically, in the first session of Code Club, we've seen problems when installing
the *tidyverse* with R versions below `R 3.6`.**

You can check which version of R you have by looking at the first lines of
output when running the following command inside R:

```r
sessionInfo()
```

#### To update:

- **Windows**: You can update R from within R. The `updateR()` function will also take care
  of updating your packages:
  
  ```r
  install.packages("installr")
  installr::updateR()
  ```

- **Mac**: Download and install the latest `.pkg` file as if you were installing it for the first time.

- **Linux**: In Ubuntu, if you installed R with `apt` or `apt-get`, you can use `apt-get upgrade` in a terminal.
  Otherwise, download and install the latest version after removing the old one.
  [Rtask has some instructions](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/installation-of-r-4-0-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-and-tips-for-spatial-packages/) for upgrading to
  R 4.0 in Ubuntu (along with upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04).

<br>

#### Re-installing your packages after updating (Mac and Linux)

While the `installr::updateR()` function for **Windows** users takes care of reinstalling
your packages along with updating R,
**Mac** and **Linux** users will have to manually re-install their packages.
Some people prefer to re-install these packages on the fly, which can end up being a way
to get rid of packages you no longer use.

But if you want immediately reinstall all your packages, run this before you upgrade:

```r
my_packages <- installed.packages()
saveRDS(my_packages, "my_packages.rds")
```

Then, after you've installed the latest R version:
```r
my_packages <- readRDS("CurrentPackages.rds")
install.packages(my_packages[1, ])
```

This will only work for packages available on CRAN. Of course, you can check your list
for Github-only and Bioconductor packages and then install those with their respective commands
(see below). Yes, this can be a bit of a hassle!
